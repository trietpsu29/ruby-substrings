# 🔤 Sub Strings

This is the seventh project from [The Odin Project](https://github.com/TheOdinProject) curriculum — a console-based implementation of substrings method that takes a word as the first argument and then an array of valid substrings (your dictionary) as the second argument. It should return a hash listing each substring (case insensitive) that was found in the original string and how many times it was found.
